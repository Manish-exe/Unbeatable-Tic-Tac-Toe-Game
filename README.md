# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C++ where a player competes against an AI that always plays the best possible move. The AI is designed to be unbeatable, meaning it either wins or forces a draw, making it a challenging opponent for the player.

## Features
- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses strategic algorithms to block player moves and prioritize winning, ensuring the player can never win.
- **Offensive and Defensive Strategies**: The AI checks for opportunities to win but also defends against the playerâ€™s possible winning moves.
- **User Interaction**: The game is controlled via simple numerical input from the player.
- **Game State Visualization**: The current state of the board is printed to the console, giving players a clear view of each move.

## How it Works
- The board is represented as a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their marker ('O' for Player, 'X' for AI) by selecting a number corresponding to an empty position.
- The AI algorithm checks for winning combinations or blocks the player's winning moves and plays accordingly.
- The game ends with either a win, draw, or loss.
